# Challenge - Weather App

<b>Name:</b> David Jimenez<br>
<b>Project:</b> Challenge - Weather App <br>
<b>Date:</b> 03/27/2024 <br>
<strong>Description:</strong>
You are to build out a weather app.

The weather app will be made where you are able to do the following:

Be able to search for a location to get the weather for

Add that city to a list of favorites

On each search, I need the ability to see the following (how you achieve this is up to you)

Current weather at the time I do the search

A general 5 day forecast

The ability to see max temp and min temp of the current day.

Desktop only build

Must pull api from https://openweathermap.org/

Must be designed

For this day you are to build out a prototype of your weather application. 

You are also going to flowchart your whole process. What we want to see is if you are able to give details to how you would build it and how things would run. Remember each function is a subprocess, which means you still have to flowchart that out.

For your figma, please link your figma in the comments.

Prototype needs to be reviewed before submission

Code is pretty clean. Asked him about the date on the main temperature. it was just a filler and showed me that it changes to what the "today's" date is. David added alot of different extra to make the code look nice and working. comment on each code block makes it easier to understand. For someone like me to peer review his code. It made me learn more of what i know because of all the explanations. As i mentioned to him he's like the chatGpt in human form with his code.
